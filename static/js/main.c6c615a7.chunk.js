Task-Oriented Development Platform",abstract:"Olfactory interfaces are pivotal in HCI, yet their development is hindered by limited application scenarios, stifling the discovery of new research opportunities. This challenge primarily stems from existing design tools focusing predominantly on odor display devices and the creation of standalone olfactory experiences, rather than enabling rapid adaptation to various contexts and tasks. Addressing this, we introduce Mul-O, a novel task-oriented development platform crafted to aid semi-professionals in navigating the diverse requirements of potential application scenarios and effectively prototyping ideas. Mul-O facilitates the swift association and integration of olfactory experiences into functional designs, system integrations, and concept validations. Comprising a web UI for task-oriented development, an API server for seamless third-party integration, and wireless olfactory display hardware, Mul-O significantly enhances the ideation and prototyping process in multisensory tasks. This was verified by a 15-day workshop attended by 30 participants.

Visually impaired players (VIPs), however, must often rely heavily on SATs to gain spatial awareness, especially in complex environments where using rich ambient sound design alone may be insufficient. Researchers have developed many SATs for facilitating spatial awareness within VIPs. Yet this abundance disguises a gap in our understanding about how exactly these approaches assist VIPs in gaining spatial awareness and what their relative merits and limitations are. To address this, we investigate four leading approaches to facilitating spatial awareness for VIPs within a 3D video game context. Our findings uncover new insights into SATs for VIPs within video games, including that VIPs value position and orientation information the most from an SAT; that none of the approaches we investigated convey position and orientation effectively; and that VIPs highly value the ability to customize SATs.",authors:["Vishnu Nair","Shao-en Ma","Ricardo E.

Sighted players use minimaps within games to learn how their surrounding environment is laid out, but there is no effective analogue to the minimap for visually impaired players. A major accessibility challenge is to create a generalized, acoustic (non-visual) version of the minimap for VIPs. To address this challenge, we develop and investigate four acoustic minimap techniques which represent a breadth of ideas for how an acoustic minimap might work: a companion smartphone app, echolocation, a directional scanner, and a simple menu. Each technique is designed to communicate information about the area around the player within a game world, providing functionality analogous to a visual minimap but in acoustic form.

IRelics allows users to experience archaeological field work activities as a serious game by using a set of tangible tools. We developed an innovative LWIR (Long Wavelength Infrared Rays) sensing system, which implements the design of tangible tools that provide real manipulation experiences. By interacting with IRelics, a player may experience different archaeological activities such as excavation and cleaning. We conducted two observations to evaluate the usability and effectiveness at archeology popularizing. Findings suggest that the IRelics platform can enhance the engagement of the participants by providing a positive and interactive environment while teaching them unfamiliar knowledge.",authors:["Qi Lu","Shao-en Ma","Jiayin Li","Haipeng Mi","Yingqing Xu"],book:"TEI '19: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction",location:"Tempe, Arizona, USA",link:"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3294109.3295647",download:"/files/IRELICS_Designing_a_Tangible_Interaction_Platform_for_the_Popularization_of_Field_Archaeology.pdf",relavance:[],tags:["cs","hci","ee","coding"]}];var H=function(e){Object(c.a)(a,e);var t=Object(m.a)(a);function a(e){var n;return Object(l.a)(this,a),(n=t.call(this,e)).state={filter:[]},n}return Object(s.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return i.a.createElement(p.a,null,i.a.createElement(g.a,{style:{display:"none"}},i.a.createElement(f.a,{sm:10},i.a.createElement(v.a,null,i.a.createElement(v.a.Body,null,i.a.createElement(v.a.Subtitle,{className:"mb-2 text-muted"},"Filter by Topic"),i.a.createElement(v.a.Text,null,i.a.createElement(S.a,null,i.a.createElement("div",{key:"custom-inline-checkbox",className:"mb-3"},i.a.createElement(S.a.Check,{custom:!0,inline:!0,label:"Physics",type:"checkbox",id:"custom-inline-checkbox-1"}),i.a.createElement(S.a.Check,{custom:!0,inline:!0,label:"Human-Computer Interaction",type:"checkbox",id:"custom-inline-checkbox-2"})))))))),i.a.createElement(g.a,null,i.a.createElement("br",null)),i.a.createElement(g.a,null,i.a.createElement(p.a,null,U.map((function(e){return t=e,i.a.createElement(g.a,null,i.a.createElement(f.a,{sm:12},i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("h5",null,t.title)),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("span",null,i.a.createElement("u",null,"Author",1==t.authors.length?"":"s"),":"," "),t.authors.map((function(e){return"Shao-en Ma"==e||"Brian Ma"==e?i.a.createElement("span",null,i.a.createElement("strong",null,e),","," "):i.a.createElement("span",null,e,", ")}))),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("i",null,t.book),i.a.createElement("span",null," | ",t.location),i.a.createElement("span",null," | ",t.dateDescription),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("a",{href:t.link,target:"_blank"},t.link)," ",t.download?i.a.createElement("span",null," ","|"," ",i.a.createElement("a",{href:t.download,target:"_blank",download:!0},"Download")):"")),i.a.createElement("br",null)));var t})))))}}]),a}(i.a.Component),L=[{type:"",code:"COMS 6998",semester:"Fall",year:"2021",title:"Advanced Web Design Studio",description:"A studio class in which students design and build prototypes for emerging technologies.",institution:"Columbia University",tags:[],relevance:["software","design","communication","research"]},{type:"",code:"COMS 4731",semester:"Fall",year:"2021",title:"Computer Vision I: First Principles",description:"Introductory course in computer vision.
